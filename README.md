## Devlog
I think Components, GameObjects, and Scenes like cooking a meal. Components are the ingredients like vegetables, or salt that give flavor and function. A GameObject is the finished dish, created by combining those ingredients in a certain way. And the Scene is the whole dinner table, where all the different dishes come together to make a full meal.
